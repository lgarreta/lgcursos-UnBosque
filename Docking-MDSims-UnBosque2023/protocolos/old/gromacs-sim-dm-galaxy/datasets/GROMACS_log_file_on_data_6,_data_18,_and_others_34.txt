Generating 1-4 interactions: fudge = 0.5

NOTE 1 [file top_input.top, line 18410]:
  You are combining position restraints with Parrinello-Rahman pressure
  coupling, which can lead to instabilities. If you really want to combine
  position restraints with pressure coupling, we suggest to use Berendsen
  pressure coupling instead.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group Protein is 4920.79
Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group non-Protein is 63837.21

NOTE 2 [file ./md.mdp]:
  Removing center of mass motion in the presence of position restraints
  might cause artifacts. When you are using position restraints to
  equilibrate a macro-molecule, the artifacts are usually negligible.

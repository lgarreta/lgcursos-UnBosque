Reading solvent configuration

Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 4x4x4 boxes
Solvent box contains 30576 atoms in 10192 residues
Removed 4338 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 3168 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  7690 residues
Generated solvent containing 23070 atoms in 7690 residues
Writing generated configuration to solv.gro

Back Off! I just backed up solv.gro to ./#solv.gro.12#

Output configuration contains 26381 atoms in 7899 residues
Volume                 :     268.205 (nm^3)
Density                :     1013.54 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   7690   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up topol.top to ./#topol.top.15#

GROMACS reminds you: "When you get right down to it, almost every explanation Man came up with for anything until about 1926 was stupid." (Dave Barry)

Adding line for 7690 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (topol.top)

Reading solute configuration
Reading solvent configuration

Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 4x4x4 boxes
Solvent box contains 30849 atoms in 10283 residues
Removed 4728 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 2469 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  7884 residues
Generated solvent containing 23652 atoms in 7884 residues
Writing generated configuration to solv.gro

Back Off! I just backed up solv.gro to ./#solv.gro.1#

Output configuration contains 26288 atoms in 8048 residues
Volume                 :     265.798 (nm^3)
Density                :     1011.95 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   7884   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up topol.top to ./#topol.top.3#

GROMACS reminds you: "FORTRAN, the infantile disorder, by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use." (Edsger Dijkstra, 1970)

Adding line for 7884 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (topol.top)
